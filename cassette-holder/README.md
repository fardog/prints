# Cassette Holder

This is a holder/stand for audio cassette tapes. It's not strictly a remix, but
was patterned off of [this gameboy cartridge holder][gameboy] and so is
[licensed](./LICENSE) under the GNU GPL v2 to match.

This model is available on [thingiverse][], and can be customized to a given
number of slots there.

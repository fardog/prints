# prints

Various [OpenSCAD][] models, STLs and gcode generated from those models. They
are either in raw SCAD, or [SolidPython][].

* SCAD files can be found in [`./scad`](./scad)
* SolidPython can be found in [`./prints`](./prints)

gcode is generated for a [Prusa i3 MK3][i3], from my [slic3r-presets][];
settings are written into the gcode, so inspect the end of the files to see what
settings they use.
